# IT-230

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

This application was developed to assist student with registering for courses available to them. This program was also designed to limit students to no more than 3 courses (9 credit hours) per term, and prevent them from registering for a course they are already registered for. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

I am confident that my work is on par with coding best standards and practices. It is clean and easy to read if it needs to be passed to another developer or team. 

# Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?

The .xaml file was crucial for creating a user friendly program. Using the console can be straightforward, but it lacks a clean look and it could confuser some users. The .xaml file helps format the same information from the console in a way that is easy for the user to uunderstand. 


# How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The new overlay for this program keeps all of the information organized in their own lists and boxes. Any important notifications, like warnings about exceeding credit hours appear in red directly in the middle of teh screen. 


# How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

I always start by trying to run the code without making any modifications so I can see what kinds of errors the compiler runs into. From there, I can begin working on any syntax errors that might be more obvious. Once the code runs properly, it is time to look for logical errors the compile will not find. A good example of this would be making sure that the limit for credit hours is 9 and not some other number, so the error messages appear at the correct time. 


# Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

I needed to innovate by modifying the .xaml.cs file because it did not have the exact overlay I was looking for. I created a new variable as to not confuse the program and created a new textbox and create a more effective space to list the registered courses.
